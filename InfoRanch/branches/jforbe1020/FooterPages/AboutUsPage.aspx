        I2C team consists of Ingrid Hines, Carole Grayson and Catherine Zenker. The 
        InfoRanch application is a Capstone project and our first together as a team. 
        Our sponsor was Dr. Overmyer from Baker College. He approached us with the idea 
        and we made the application happen. We were students at Baker College but have 
        graduated as part of an elite class of 15 MIS graduates in 2009. As well as 
        working regular jobs we will be involved with website as a hobby project along 
        with Dr.Overmyer.</p>
